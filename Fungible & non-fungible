Fungible Tokens (Interchangeable Items):
Currency: Physical cash, like coins or paper money, is a classic example of a fungible token. A $10 bill or a 1-euro coin can be exchanged with another identical one, and their value remains constant. The specific bill or coin doesn’t matter, only its value does.
Loyalty Points: Think of a supermarket’s reward points or airline miles. Whether you have 500 or 5,000 points, each point has the same value and can be redeemed for goods or services in exactly the same way. This makes them fungible.
Concert Tickets (General Admission): A concert ticket for general admission that doesn’t specify a seat is fungible. Each ticket grants the same access to the event, and one ticket can be exchanged for another without any difference in the user experience.
Gift Cards: A $50 gift card from a store like Amazon is fungible, meaning one $50 gift card is equivalent to another $50 card in value and usability.

Non-Fungible Tokens (Unique Items):
Diplomas or Certificates: As mentioned earlier, diplomas from educational institutions are non-fungible because each one is unique to the individual who earned it. Even though they might look similar, each certificate carries the specific student’s name, institution, and qualifications. They are not interchangeable, as their value is tied to the personal achievements of the holder.
Driver’s License or Passport: These identification documents are non-fungible. Each one contains unique details (name, date of birth, ID number) and is specific to the individual. You can’t trade your passport or driver’s license with someone else; they are uniquely yours.
Concert Tickets (Assigned Seating): A concert ticket with a specific seat number is non-fungible. Each seat provides a different view and experience, and swapping tickets with another person may result in a different location or a worse seat.
Artwork or Collectibles: Original paintings, such as those displayed in galleries, are non-fungible. Even if two artworks are by the same artist or are of the same subject, each piece is unique in terms of materials, history, and details, making them irreplaceable.
